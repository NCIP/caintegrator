- Output from analysis may create new groupings or lists (gene lists, for example)

- Allow for arbitrary creation of lists / groupings (not just query results)

	- Gene lists may be several hundred long (allow for delimited text upload)
	
- KM Plot & T-Test (grouping) example

	- Select some samples (subset of all) -- (e.g. all brain tumor samples only)
	
		- remove outlier, etc.
		
		- ...and survival less than 2 years
		
	- Define subgroups (1 each for line on KM plot)
	
		- Compare Grade III to Grade IV (example)
		
	- Example, use T-Test to get or refine gene list
	
		- Input: matrix of expression values by genes and by samples (in 2 groups)
		
		- Result: p-value, ratio or fold change per gene
		
		- Output: Gene list filtered by user selected threshhold of one of the above.
		
- Copy and update data set definitions
	 - Record how created in order to recreate lists

- Static and dynamic (query based) lists
		
- Group examples

	- Above: samples by grade
	
	- Based on arbitrary clinical attributes (images or subjects)
	
	- Unsupervised clustering (to generate groups)
	
		- Takes ungrouped data and creates n number of groups
		
	- Arbitrarily user-defined groups
	
	- Male / female or left / right hemisphere
	
	- Pick only samples with blood pressure, etc...
	
- Want research investigator to be able to add attributes to existing data

	- Example, cell lines grown in different media -- this wasn't captured in clinical or genomic apps
	
		- Actually, creation of sample lists, etc. is sufficient for this
		
- Description text search may be helpful (maybe not)

- Sample name pattern may be useful
		
- Tools

	- Lots of R modules
	
	- in caIntegrator (implemented -- runs through R)
	
	- GenePattern
