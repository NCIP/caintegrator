4/9/08 METHYLATION DATA REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW
=============================================

Methylation 101

	Methylation is to C preceding a T

	Transcription factor attachs to promoter and begins transcription.

	In front of or behind promoter you may have CpG (C-phospate-G) islands.

		- Depends who you ask, but defined as 300bp > 50% CG

	Methylation has several functions

		- Indicates which is original DNA and which is copy

		- Regulates expression
	
	Amplification can't be used for methylation data
	
	Two assays to check for methylation
	
		- (Always do bisulfite mod before)
	
		- Short oligo probes targeted to methylation (Agilent 71mers)
		
			- probes come in two forms SO (short oligo) Methylated and SO-non-methylated
			
			- 10 micrograms and up of DNA required
		
		- Methylation IP (Immuno Precipitation)
		
			- Chop up 10 ug of DNA (smash it up to about 200-300bp chunks)
			
			- Some pieces are methylated some are not
			
			- Use antibody that binds to Methylated
			
			- Antibody is heavy falls to bottom, you get 1 ug of all methylated chunks
			
		- 100 ug of DNA --> Bisulfate it --> nPCR (?what's this)
		
			- Put result in Affymetrix promoter array (tiling arrays)
			
				- Affy tiling arrays go 5k bp back from 1st transcribed exon (21-mer followed by 35mer, repeat)
				
					- Tiling arrays always used for sequencing
		
	- Original assay was Methylation Specific PCR (MSPCR)
	
		- Bisulfite modification to CpG islands
			
			- Everything not methylated changed to a T
			
				from: * *
				      CGCGAAGGCCCG
				to    CGCGAAGGCCTG
				
		- Problem is methylation must be right where primer is located
		
	- Often don't know where promoters are for genes
	
	- For promoter region let's say half of the CpG islands are methylated; is the promoter methylated?
	
		- Answer is dependent on whether CpG is transcription binding site
		
		- Need to look at expression data as well to see if transcription was turned off
		
	- Methylation is not the most common transcription inhibitor
	
		- Actually chromatin mechanism to fold DNA more common, but harder to study
		
	- Example: methylation is mechanism that prevents production of sex hormones prior to puberty
	
	- Need to look at both methylation and hypomethylation (loss of methylation)
	
	- Look at % probes methylated --> expression of gene compared against normals
	
	- Can also do copy number -- expression correlation to find methylation
	
	- Methylation data not shown on global scale, shown on gene by gene scale (across samples)
	
- Ideal representation of how to show methylation data ("what I want")

	- % probes methylated for a particular gene (gives me an idea, but not necessarily reliable)
	
	- For a single gene and single sample, show side by side bar graph of % probes methylated and mRNA expression
	
	- For a single gene and all samples, plot % probes meth vs. expression level
	
		- Select samples in clusters:
		
			- View spreadsheet probes vs. samples

	- View bar graph: all samples / one gene
	
		- y axis % of samples methylated
		
		- x axis: probes
		
	- Look at any of the above, 2 side by side (or separate colors, but not preferred) of 2 clinical values
	
		- e.g. outcome; high survival vs. low survival
		
- Have seen papers that describe high throughput methylation methodology, but haven't seen papers that have found biological results from these methodologies.
