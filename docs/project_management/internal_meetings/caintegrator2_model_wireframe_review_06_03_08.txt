1.	Security level – needs further evaluation (Level 1/Level 2 etc) . For this release if you have access to study, you can see everything.
2.	CTODS integration is not part of this release, but will be shown as a future functionality. Future integration with COPPA will be evaluated when COPPA is ready. 
3.	Patient to Sample mapping instead of Patient to Files for Genomic Data Patient Mapping page
4.	Rembrandt clinical data from production (already transformed from MD Anderson report) will be used as a clinical data
5.	Annotation data (Gene/Reporter etc) for this release will be loaded manually 
6.	Using annotation from caBIO will be evaluated. 
7.	‘Field Definition’ pages will be changed so that the field definitions are shown as rows for better UI. 
8.	A help feature (documentation or other means) will be provided so that Study Manager can get details of other systems (URL, UserID, Password, Port etc) 
9. 	Remove 'File Has Header Line' option.  It always has a header line.
10. 	For the pages that assign field types/names to file input, show the header line from the file with each column. 
11. 	Need to be able to only load a subset of samples for a caArray experiment.  Do this by only mapping some data files to samples.
