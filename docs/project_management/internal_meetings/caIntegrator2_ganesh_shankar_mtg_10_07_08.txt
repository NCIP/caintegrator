Notes from Meeting with Ganesh Shankar from Indiana University School of Medicine

Shine and Will talked with Ganesh on 10/7/08

He said he was interested in caIntegrator2, but had several good questions.  He asked about time points,
such as pre- and post-surgery.

And he wanted to know about saving of results, especially in the case of doing an analysis for publication.
He wanted a good way of going back to a full query result and validating it.

His biggest concern was about summarization of probesets for a gene.  He said they routinely do this and
would only consider analyzing data that was a gene-level summary.  We discussed several ways of doing this:
	
	1. Store summary data in caArray after pulling out the probeset-level data and calculating it themselves.
	2. Calculate summary data themselves and then loading it into caIntegrator2 directly (through file?)
	3. Have caIntegrator2 do the calculations and give the option of using that gene-level data or the
	   probeset data.

He said he would check to see what sumarization algorithms they usuaully used.  And he would see if he could get
us some de-identified clinical data.
