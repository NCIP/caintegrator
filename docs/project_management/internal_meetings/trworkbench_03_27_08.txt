- We need to ensure that terminology determines difference between study data and investigator data

- Bench scientist and physician scientist may have different workflows, potentially different actors.

- Silver API is in scope!

- Add new data in scope for 1.0, and add new data element in scope for 1.0

- Save groupings, data sets in scope for 1.0; recording workflow (analysis configuration) not in scope for 1.0

- !!! We need to account for security for protected (identifying) data (e.g. genotype data)

- We will have shared queries, etc.

- Always at least some clinical and some genomic data

- Systems in scope for data retrieval
	- Clinical
		- delimited text
		- CTODS
	- Genomic
		- caArray (2.0)
		- ? Binary file (for computed data). R file?
	- Imaging
		- delimited text (for image annotations)
		- NCIA
		
- caTissue not in scope.
		
- Follow up with Subha on details for TCGA Mutation Data scenario

- Genomic data in scope for 1.0 (Still in flux, Subha will decide by 4/3). Send reminder on tuesday.
