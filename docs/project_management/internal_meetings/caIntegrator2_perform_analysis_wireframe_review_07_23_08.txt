Notes from Meeting Subha about Perform Analysis Wireframes - 7/23/08

Will and Subha met to go over the Perform Analysis wireframes as she missed the last review of these.

She liked the idea of having controlled-vocabulary categories for selecting sets of patients but did ask about
using patient lists that had been previously stored.  I said we'd do that but since we hadn't worked on how to create
and manage those lists we couldn't do it now.  She liked the idea of specifying survival values at Study Deploy time
and that there might be more than one (she said the two that she knew about were time since diagnosis and time since
surgery).

For the gene expression plots she said that she supported having gene summary expression as the default but that
probe-level expression should still be an option.  She didn't know what gene summary method was best but said JC and
Yuri would be good contacts.

She also liked having sets of controls for fold change calculations being defined at deploy study time, but that it was
always possible to not have controls and just use the median expression for that gene as the control.

For genepattern she said we should shoot for seamless integration, a la Rembrandt (not in production, however) but that
just cutting over to GenePattern is an acceptable stop gap method.
