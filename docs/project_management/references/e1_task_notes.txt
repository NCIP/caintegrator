ARCHITECTURE
=================

Hibernate

Struts 2

- Find out if we need to caCORE

	-- Assuming not, go EJB3, Hibernate or JPA annotations
	

NetCDF or ?

	- R binary to integrate with current analysis tools
	
	- Check format consumed by external analysis tools
	
Postgres



PROCESS
=================

Ant vs. Maven

Peer review
	- Try it for E1, re-evaluate afterward

SCHEDULE

- June 23 - 25 is caBIG annual meeting; Subha would like a demo

	- 9 weeks from now
	
- 2 four week elaboration iterations

	- 4/21 - 5/16
	- 5/19 - 6/13
